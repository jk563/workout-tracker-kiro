# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing S3 CloudFront hosting infrastructure to add custom domain support for the workout tracker application. The solution will configure custom domains for both production (`workout-tracker.jamiekelly.com`) and development (`workout-tracker-dev.jamiekelly.com`) environments, using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for SSL certificates and Route 53 for DNS management. The implementation must handle the requirement that ACM certificates for CloudFront must be created in the `us-east-1` region.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure custom domains for different environments, so that the workout tracker can be accessed via branded URLs instead of CloudFront distribution URLs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN the production environment SHALL be accessible at `workout-tracker.jamiekelly.com`
2. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN the development environment SHALL be accessible at `workout-tracker-dev.jamiekelly.com`
3. WHEN a user accesses either custom domain THEN they SHALL be redirected to HTTPS automatically
4. WHEN the custom domains are configured THEN they SHALL use the existing CloudFront distribution architecture

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want SSL certificates managed by AWS Certificate Manager, so that the custom domains are secured with valid SSL certificates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ACM certificates are created THEN they SHALL be created in the `us-east-1` region for CloudFront compatibility
2. WHEN ACM certificates are created THEN they SHALL cover both production and development subdomains
3. WHEN ACM certificates are created THEN they SHALL be validated using DNS validation method
4. WHEN certificates are validated THEN they SHALL be automatically renewed by AWS
5. WHEN certificates are attached to CloudFront THEN they SHALL enforce HTTPS-only access

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Route 53 DNS records configured, so that the custom domains resolve to the CloudFront distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Route 53 records are created THEN they SHALL point the custom domains to the CloudFront distribution
2. WHEN Route 53 records are created THEN they SHALL use ALIAS records for optimal performance
3. WHEN DNS validation is required THEN Route 53 SHALL automatically create the necessary CNAME records for ACM validation
4. WHEN the hosted zone exists THEN the implementation SHALL use the existing `jamiekelly.com` hosted zone

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want environment-specific configuration, so that I can deploy to different environments with appropriate domain names.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Terraform is applied THEN it SHALL support environment variables or workspace-based configuration
2. WHEN deploying to production THEN it SHALL use `workout-tracker.jamiekelly.com`
3. WHEN deploying to development THEN it SHALL use `workout-tracker-dev.jamiekelly.com`
4. WHEN switching environments THEN the configuration SHALL be isolated and not interfere with other environments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated deployment scripts, so that I can deploy to the custom domain endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment script is updated THEN it SHALL work with both CloudFront URLs and custom domains
2. WHEN deployment is complete THEN it SHALL provide the correct custom domain URL for access
3. WHEN cache invalidation occurs THEN it SHALL work correctly with custom domain configuration
4. WHEN deployment fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages about domain-related issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want proper Terraform outputs, so that I can access the custom domain URLs and certificate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Terraform is applied THEN it SHALL output the custom domain URL for the current environment
2. WHEN Terraform is applied THEN it SHALL output the ACM certificate ARN for reference
3. WHEN Terraform is applied THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing outputs
