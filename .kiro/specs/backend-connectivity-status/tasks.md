# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement backend health check endpoint
  - Create health check handler in Go Lambda function
  - Add request routing logic to distinguish between health checks and existing functionality
  - Implement structured JSON response with status, timestamp, and version
  - Add comprehensive error handling for health check failures
  - Include health check logging with structured JSON format
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Create frontend health check service
  - Implement HealthCheckService class with fetch-based HTTP requests
  - Add timeout handling using AbortController for request cancellation
  - Implement error handling for network failures, timeouts, and HTTP errors
  - Add retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests
  - Create TypeScript interfaces for health check responses and service methods
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Build ConnectivityStatus React component
  - Create component with three visual states: checking (amber), healthy (green), unhealthy (red)
  - Implement state management for connectivity status and last check timestamp using React hooks
  - Add pulsing animation for checking state using CSS animations
  - Include proper ARIA labels and accessibility attributes for screen readers
  - Use existing CSS custom properties for consistent theming and dark mode support
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Implement automatic connectivity polling
  - Add periodic health check polling with configurable interval (default 30 seconds)
  - Implement proper cleanup of timers and requests when component unmounts using useEffect
  - Add debouncing to prevent multiple simultaneous health check requests
  - Handle race conditions between multiple connectivity checks appropriately
  - Include initial connectivity check when component mounts
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Integrate component into application layout
  - Add ConnectivityStatus component to Layout.jsx in top right position
  - Ensure component appears on all pages without interfering with existing content
  - Implement responsive positioning that works on mobile and desktop viewports
  - Test component visibility and layout integration across different screen sizes
  - Verify component doesn't cause layout shifts during status transitions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Configure Terraform infrastructure for health endpoint
  - Add API Gateway resource configuration for `/api/health` path
  - Configure GET method integration with Lambda function using AWS_PROXY integration
  - Implement CORS configuration with OPTIONS method for preflight requests
  - Set up proper CORS headers for frontend domain access
  - Configure environment-specific API Gateway deployment stages
  - Add CloudWatch logging configuration for health endpoint monitoring
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6_

- [x] 7. Write comprehensive tests
  - Create unit tests for HealthCheckService with mocked fetch requests
  - Write unit tests for ConnectivityStatus component covering all visual states
  - Add integration tests for polling behavior and error handling
  - Create E2E tests to verify component visibility and status changes
  - Test accessibility features with screen reader compatibility
  - Add infrastructure tests to verify API Gateway routing and CORS configuration
  - _Requirements: All requirements - comprehensive testing coverage_
