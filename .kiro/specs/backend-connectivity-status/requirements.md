# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a visual connectivity status indicator to the workout tracker web application that monitors the connection to the backend API via a healthcheck endpoint. The component provides real-time feedback to users about the backend service availability, helping them understand when data operations may be affected by connectivity issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the workout tracker application, I want to see a visual indicator of the backend connection status, so that I know when the application can successfully communicate with the server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the connectivity status component SHALL be visible in the top right corner of the webapp
2. WHEN the connectivity check is in progress THEN the component SHALL display an amber/yellow color indicator
3. WHEN the backend healthcheck endpoint responds successfully THEN the component SHALL display a green color indicator
4. WHEN the backend healthcheck endpoint fails or is unreachable THEN the component SHALL display a red color indicator

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the connectivity status to update automatically, so that I have current information about the backend availability without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component is mounted THEN it SHALL immediately perform an initial connectivity check
2. WHEN the initial check completes THEN the component SHALL continue checking connectivity at regular intervals
3. WHEN a connectivity check is performed THEN the visual indicator SHALL update to reflect the current status
4. WHEN the component is unmounted THEN any ongoing connectivity checks SHALL be properly cleaned up

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the connectivity status indicator to be unobtrusive but clearly visible, so that it provides useful information without interfering with my workout tracking activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page of the application THEN the connectivity status component SHALL be positioned in the top right corner
2. WHEN the connectivity status is displayed THEN it SHALL use appropriate visual styling that is consistent with the application's design system
3. WHEN the connectivity status changes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and not cause layout shifts
4. WHEN the component is displayed THEN it SHALL be accessible to screen readers with appropriate ARIA labels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the connectivity status component to handle errors gracefully, so that network issues don't cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the healthcheck request times out THEN the component SHALL treat this as a failed connection and display red status
2. WHEN the healthcheck request encounters a network error THEN the component SHALL handle the error gracefully and display red status
3. WHEN the healthcheck endpoint returns a non-200 status code THEN the component SHALL treat this as a failed connection
4. WHEN multiple connectivity checks are triggered simultaneously THEN the component SHALL handle this appropriately without causing race conditions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to provide a dedicated health check endpoint, so that the frontend can reliably monitor backend service availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/health` THEN the backend SHALL respond with a JSON object containing status information
2. WHEN the backend service is healthy THEN the `/api/health` endpoint SHALL return HTTP 200 status with `{"status": "ok", "timestamp": "ISO-8601-timestamp"}`
3. WHEN the backend service encounters issues THEN the `/api/health` endpoint SHALL return HTTP 503 status with `{"status": "error", "timestamp": "ISO-8601-timestamp", "message": "error-description"}`
4. WHEN the health check endpoint is called THEN it SHALL respond within 100ms to ensure fast connectivity checks
5. WHEN the health check endpoint is accessed THEN it SHALL include appropriate CORS headers to allow frontend requests
6. WHEN health check requests are processed THEN they SHALL be logged using structured JSON format for monitoring purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the infrastructure to properly route and expose the health check endpoint, so that the frontend can access it reliably across all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Terraform infrastructure is deployed THEN it SHALL configure API Gateway to route `/api/health` requests to the Lambda function
2. WHEN the API Gateway receives a request to `/api/health` THEN it SHALL forward the request to the Lambda function with proper integration
3. WHEN the Lambda function processes health check requests THEN the API Gateway SHALL return the response with appropriate HTTP status codes
4. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the API Gateway SHALL include the necessary CORS headers for the frontend domain
5. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed in different environments THEN the `/api/health` endpoint SHALL be accessible in both development and production
6. WHEN API Gateway routes are configured THEN they SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing endpoints
