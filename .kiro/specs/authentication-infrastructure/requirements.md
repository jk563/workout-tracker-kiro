# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes the foundational infrastructure for user authentication in the workout tracker application. The system will provide a secure, cost-effective data store for user credentials using AWS DynamoDB, designed to be separate from other application data stores for security isolation. The infrastructure will support basic username/password authentication with proper hashing and salting mechanisms, optimized for pay-per-request pricing and Lambda function access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a dedicated DynamoDB table for storing user authentication data, so that user credentials are isolated from other application data for enhanced security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL create a DynamoDB table specifically for authentication data
2. WHEN the table is created THEN it SHALL be configured with pay-per-request billing mode for cost efficiency
3. WHEN the table is created THEN it SHALL have appropriate encryption at rest enabled
4. WHEN the table is created THEN it SHALL be tagged with environment and project identifiers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the DynamoDB table to have an optimized schema for authentication lookups, so that user login operations are fast and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the table schema is defined THEN it SHALL use a hashed user ID (derived from email) as the primary key
2. WHEN a user record is stored THEN it SHALL contain a hashed and salted password field
3. WHEN the table is queried THEN it SHALL support efficient lookups by the hashed user ID
4. WHEN the schema is implemented THEN it SHALL minimize storage costs while maintaining query performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Lambda function, I want appropriate IAM permissions to access the authentication DynamoDB table, so that I can perform user authentication operations securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lambda functions need to access the table THEN they SHALL have read permissions for user lookup operations
2. WHEN Lambda functions need to create users THEN they SHALL have write permissions for user registration
3. WHEN IAM policies are created THEN they SHALL follow the principle of least privilege
4. WHEN permissions are granted THEN they SHALL be scoped specifically to the authentication table

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the authentication infrastructure to be environment-aware, so that development and production environments have separate authentication data stores.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure is deployed to different environments THEN each SHALL have its own dedicated authentication table
2. WHEN table names are generated THEN they SHALL include environment identifiers to prevent conflicts
3. WHEN environment-specific resources are created THEN they SHALL be properly tagged for identification
4. WHEN switching between environments THEN the correct authentication table SHALL be used automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the authentication table to implement security best practices, so that user credential data is protected against unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the table is created THEN it SHALL have server-side encryption enabled
2. WHEN access patterns are defined THEN they SHALL prevent unauthorized data access
3. WHEN the table is configured THEN it SHALL have appropriate backup and recovery settings
4. WHEN monitoring is implemented THEN it SHALL track access patterns and potential security events
