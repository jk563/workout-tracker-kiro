# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the backend authentication API for the workout tracker application. The system will provide secure user registration and login endpoints that interact with the existing DynamoDB authentication infrastructure. The implementation will use standard session token practices with JWT tokens, secure password hashing, and proper error handling for authentication flows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register an account with email and password, so that I can access the workout tracker application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits registration data THEN the system SHALL validate the email format and password strength
2. WHEN a valid registration request is received THEN the system SHALL hash the email to create a user ID
3. WHEN storing user credentials THEN the system SHALL salt and hash the password using bcrypt
4. WHEN a user already exists THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response
5. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL return a success response without sensitive data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to login with my email and password, so that I can authenticate and access protected features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits login credentials THEN the system SHALL validate the email format
2. WHEN valid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL lookup the user by hashed email
3. WHEN the user exists THEN the system SHALL verify the password against the stored hash
4. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL generate a JWT session token
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error without revealing user existence

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my session to be maintained securely, so that I don't need to re-authenticate for every request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JWT token is generated THEN it SHALL contain user identification and expiration time
2. WHEN a JWT token is created THEN it SHALL be signed with a secure secret key
3. WHEN a JWT token expires THEN subsequent requests SHALL be rejected with appropriate error
4. WHEN a JWT token is validated THEN the system SHALL verify signature and expiration
5. WHEN token validation fails THEN the system SHALL return unauthorized error response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want authentication middleware for API endpoints, so that protected routes require valid authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a protected endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL check for Authorization header
2. WHEN a valid JWT token is provided THEN the request SHALL proceed with user context
3. WHEN no token is provided THEN the system SHALL return unauthorized error
4. WHEN an invalid token is provided THEN the system SHALL return unauthorized error
5. WHEN token validation succeeds THEN user information SHALL be available to the handler

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that authentication issues can be diagnosed and monitored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication events occur THEN the system SHALL log structured JSON messages
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details without exposing sensitive data
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log failed attempts for monitoring
4. WHEN successful authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL log success events
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL return generic error messages to clients

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want password and token security best practices implemented, so that user credentials are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN passwords are hashed THEN the system SHALL use bcrypt with appropriate cost factor
2. WHEN JWT tokens are generated THEN they SHALL have reasonable expiration times
3. WHEN sensitive operations occur THEN the system SHALL not log passwords or tokens
4. WHEN errors are returned THEN they SHALL not reveal system implementation details
5. WHEN authentication data is processed THEN it SHALL follow secure coding practices
