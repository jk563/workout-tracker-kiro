# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing Svelte 5 + SvelteKit 2 frontend application to the latest version of React (React 19) with Vite as the build tool. The migration will maintain all existing functionality while updating the technology stack, testing framework, and deployment scripts to work with the new React-based architecture. The goal is to preserve the current user experience and feature set while leveraging React's latest features and maintaining the current Vite development experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the migrated React application to have identical functionality to the current Svelte application, so that I can continue using all existing features without any disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the React application loads THEN the system SHALL display the same landing page layout and content as the current Svelte version
2. WHEN users interact with connectivity status features THEN the system SHALL provide identical behavior and visual feedback as the Svelte implementation
3. WHEN users navigate through the application THEN the system SHALL maintain the same routing structure and page transitions
4. WHEN the application renders on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design behavior identical to the Svelte version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React application to use modern React patterns and Vite tooling, so that the codebase follows current best practices and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing components THEN the system SHALL use React 19 functional components with the latest hooks and features
2. WHEN setting up routing THEN the system SHALL use React Router v6 for client-side routing
3. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use appropriate React state management patterns (useState, useContext, etc.)
4. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL use Vite 7 as the build tool and development server
5. WHEN implementing styling THEN the system SHALL maintain Tailwind CSS 4 with the same design system and theme configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the React application, so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN the system SHALL use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing
2. WHEN running end-to-end tests THEN the system SHALL use Playwright with the same test scenarios as the Svelte version
3. WHEN measuring test coverage THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 80% code coverage across all components and utilities
4. WHEN executing tests THEN the system SHALL include tests for all migrated components, services, and utilities
5. WHEN running the test suite THEN all tests SHALL pass before considering any migration task complete

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build and deployment process to work seamlessly with the React application, so that I can deploy to the same infrastructure without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL generate static files compatible with the existing S3 + CloudFront hosting setup
2. WHEN running the deployment script THEN the system SHALL work with the existing `deploy-frontend.sh` script without modification to the infrastructure
3. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL optimize bundle size and performance to match or exceed the current Svelte build
4. WHEN configuring the build process THEN the system SHALL maintain the same environment-based configuration (development/production)
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL generate the same file structure expected by the CloudFront distribution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React application to maintain the same development workflow and tooling, so that the development experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting development THEN the system SHALL provide hot reload functionality using Vite's React plugin
2. WHEN running code quality checks THEN the system SHALL use ESLint and Prettier with equivalent rules to the Svelte configuration
3. WHEN following the project structure THEN the system SHALL organize components, utilities, and tests in a logical React/Next.js structure
4. WHEN importing dependencies THEN the system SHALL maintain the same external libraries where possible (Tailwind, testing libraries, etc.)
5. WHEN running development scripts THEN the system SHALL provide equivalent npm scripts for dev, build, test, and quality checks using Vite commands

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript support in the React application, so that I can benefit from type safety and better development experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing components THEN the system SHALL support TypeScript with proper type definitions for props and state
2. WHEN configuring the project THEN the system SHALL include TypeScript configuration optimized for the latest React and Vite
3. WHEN importing modules THEN the system SHALL provide proper type checking for all imports and exports
4. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL perform type checking as part of the build process
5. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL provide IntelliSense and type hints in the development environment
