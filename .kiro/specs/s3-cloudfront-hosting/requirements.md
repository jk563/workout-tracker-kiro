# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing Terraform infrastructure to add S3 static website hosting with CloudFront distribution for the frontend webapp. The solution will provide a scalable, cost-effective hosting platform for the Svelte-based workout tracker application, using CloudFront for global content delivery and caching. The implementation will integrate with the existing Terraform setup and follow AWS best practices for static website hosting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to create an S3 bucket for static content storage, so that the frontend webapp files can be stored and served via CloudFront.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the S3 bucket is created THEN it SHALL be configured to store static website files
2. WHEN the S3 bucket is created THEN it SHALL be private with no public access
3. WHEN the S3 bucket is created THEN it SHALL be accessible only via CloudFront using Origin Access Control
4. WHEN the S3 bucket is created THEN it SHALL follow the naming convention for the workout tracker project

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to create a CloudFront distribution, so that the webapp is served globally with improved performance and caching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CloudFront distribution is created THEN it SHALL use the S3 bucket as the origin
2. WHEN the CloudFront distribution is created THEN it SHALL be configured for SPA (Single Page Application) routing
3. WHEN the CloudFront distribution is created THEN it SHALL redirect all 404 errors to index.html for client-side routing
4. WHEN the CloudFront distribution is created THEN it SHALL use appropriate caching policies for static assets
5. WHEN the CloudFront distribution is created THEN it SHALL be enabled and ready to serve traffic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want proper security configurations, so that the hosting setup follows AWS security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CloudFront distribution is created THEN it SHALL use Origin Access Control (OAC) for secure S3 access
2. WHEN the security configuration is applied THEN direct S3 access SHALL be restricted, forcing traffic through CloudFront
3. WHEN the configuration is applied THEN it SHALL follow the principle of least privilege

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a deployment script, so that I can easily deploy the built frontend application to the S3 bucket.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment script is created THEN it SHALL build the frontend application
2. WHEN the deployment script is created THEN it SHALL sync the built files to the S3 bucket
3. WHEN the deployment script is created THEN it SHALL invalidate the CloudFront cache after deployment
4. WHEN the deployment script is created THEN it SHALL provide clear feedback on deployment status
5. WHEN the deployment script is executed THEN it SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Terraform outputs for the hosting infrastructure, so that I can easily access the CloudFront URL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Terraform is applied THEN it SHALL output the CloudFront distribution domain name
