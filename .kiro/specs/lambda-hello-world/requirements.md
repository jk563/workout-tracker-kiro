# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a simple AWS Lambda function written in Go that returns "Hello World" when invoked. The function will be located in the `./backend/core` directory and will use zerolog for structured logging. The implementation will follow Go best practices and include comprehensive testing with both unit and integration tests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a basic AWS Lambda function in Go, so that I can have a foundation for serverless backend functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda function is invoked THEN the system SHALL return "Hello World" as the response
2. WHEN the Lambda function executes THEN the system SHALL use zerolog for structured logging
3. WHEN the Lambda function is deployed THEN the system SHALL be located in the `./backend/core` directory structure
4. WHEN the Lambda function runs THEN the system SHALL follow Go best practices for code organization and structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing for the Lambda function, so that I can ensure reliability and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN the system SHALL test the core Lambda handler logic in isolation
2. WHEN integration tests are executed THEN the system SHALL test the Lambda function as a complete unit
3. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL achieve adequate test coverage for all implemented functionality
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL follow Go testing best practices and conventions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper project structure and dependencies, so that the Lambda function is maintainable and follows Go conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN the system SHALL use proper Go module initialization with go.mod
2. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL include AWS Lambda Go runtime and zerolog dependencies
3. WHEN the code is organized THEN the system SHALL separate handler logic from main function for testability
4. WHEN the project is built THEN the system SHALL produce a deployable Lambda binary
