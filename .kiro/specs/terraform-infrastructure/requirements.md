# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a foundational Terraform configuration for AWS infrastructure management. The configuration will follow HashiCorp best practices and provide a solid foundation for future infrastructure deployments. The primary goal is to create a working Terraform setup that can initialize, plan, and apply successfully using S3 remote state backend with DynamoDB state locking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a properly configured Terraform setup with AWS provider, so that I can manage infrastructure as code following industry best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Terraform is initialized THEN the AWS provider SHALL be configured and ready for use
2. WHEN terraform init is executed THEN the S3 backend SHALL be configured to use the existing `jamiekelly-terraform-state` bucket
3. WHEN terraform init is executed THEN DynamoDB state locking SHALL be configured using the existing `jamiekelly-terraform-state-locaking` table
4. WHEN terraform plan is executed THEN it SHALL complete successfully without errors
5. WHEN terraform apply is executed THEN it SHALL complete successfully without creating any resources initially

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the Terraform configuration to follow HashiCorp best practices, so that the infrastructure code is maintainable and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the Terraform configuration THEN it SHALL use proper file organization with separate files for providers, variables, and outputs
2. WHEN reviewing the Terraform configuration THEN it SHALL include appropriate version constraints for Terraform and providers
3. WHEN reviewing the Terraform configuration THEN it SHALL use consistent naming conventions and formatting
4. WHEN reviewing the Terraform configuration THEN it SHALL include proper documentation and comments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the Terraform configuration to be region-specific to eu-west-2, so that all resources are deployed in the correct AWS region by default.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AWS provider is configured THEN it SHALL default to the eu-west-2 region
2. WHEN the S3 backend is configured THEN it SHALL specify eu-west-2 as the region
3. WHEN terraform plan is executed THEN any future resources SHALL be planned for deployment in eu-west-2

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the Terraform configuration to be stored in a dedicated infrastructure directory, so that infrastructure code is properly organized and separated from application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Terraform configuration is created THEN it SHALL be located in the `./infrastructure` directory
2. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN the infrastructure directory SHALL contain all Terraform-related files
3. WHEN working with the infrastructure THEN it SHALL be independent of the application code structure
