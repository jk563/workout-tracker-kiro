# Frontend Webapp Design Document

## Overview

The Workout Tracker frontend webapp will be built as a single-page application (SPA) using Svelte as the primary framework. Svelte was chosen for its minimal runtime overhead, excellent performance, and developer experience. The application will feature a clean, responsive design with a lightweight CSS framework and comprehensive testing setup.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Svelte with SvelteKit for routing and build tooling
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit testing, Playwright for end-to-end testing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with minimal bundle size
- **Build Tool**: Vite (integrated with SvelteKit) for fast development and optimized builds
- **Package Manager**: npm with package-lock.json for reproducible builds

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Components

#### 1. App Shell (`src/app.html`)
- Main HTML template with meta tags for SEO and responsive design
- Includes Tailwind CSS and application mounting point

#### 2. Landing Page (`src/routes/+page.svelte`)
- Primary entry point displaying "Workout Tracker" title
- Centered layout with responsive design
- Foundation for future feature additions

#### 3. Layout Components
- Header component with main title
- Main content area with proper spacing and alignment
- Responsive grid system using Tailwind utilities

### Styling Architecture

#### Tailwind CSS Configuration
- Custom color palette aligned with fitness/health theme
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile-first design
- Component utilities for consistent spacing and typography
- Purged CSS for minimal production bundle size

#### Design System
- Typography scale with clear hierarchy
- Color scheme with primary, secondary, and accent colors
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- Accessible color contrasts meeting WCAG AA standards

## Data Models

### Initial State Management
- No complex state management needed for initial landing page
- Prepared for future integration with state management (Svelte stores)
- Component-level state using Svelte's reactive declarations

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Error Handling
- Global error boundary for unhandled exceptions
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation for network issues
- Console logging for development debugging

### Development vs Production
- Detailed error information in development mode
- Sanitized error messages in production
- Error reporting integration points for future monitoring

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing with Vitest
- Component testing for Svelte components
- Utility function testing
- Mock external dependencies
- Coverage reporting with threshold enforcement

### End-to-End Testing with Playwright
- Landing page load and display verification
- Responsive design testing across devices
- Accessibility testing with axe-core integration
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Optimization
- Svelte's compile-time optimizations
- Tailwind CSS purging for minimal CSS bundle
- Vite's tree-shaking and code splitting
- Asset optimization and compression

### Loading Performance
- Critical CSS inlining
- Preload hints for important resources
- Lazy loading for future components
- Service worker preparation for caching

### Runtime Performance
- Svelte's reactive updates without virtual DOM overhead
- Minimal JavaScript runtime footprint
- Efficient event handling and DOM manipulation
- Memory leak prevention patterns

## Accessibility

### WCAG Compliance
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance

### Implementation Details
- ARIA labels and descriptions where needed
- Focus management for interactive elements
- Alternative text for images
- Form accessibility patterns for future features

## Development Workflow

### Development Server
- Hot module replacement for fast development
- Source maps for debugging
- Development-specific error overlays
- Auto-refresh on file changes

### Build Process
- Production optimization with Vite
- Static asset processing and optimization
- Environment-specific configuration
- Build artifact verification

### Code Quality
- ESLint configuration for code consistency
- Prettier for code formatting
- TypeScript support preparation for future enhancement
